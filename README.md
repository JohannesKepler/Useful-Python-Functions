# Useful-Python-Functions
Some functions I have accumulated while working on Project Euler problems.

Each python file should have a main() method that is called if you run the program directly. Alternatively you can import the functions to use in other programs as you need.

Author's Note: While some of these functions will only just get you started on solving a Project Euler problem, others will get you almost all the way there. Please don't deprive yourself of the satisfaction of solving the problems yourself by using these as solution guides!
